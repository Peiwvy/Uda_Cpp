Inherited Access Specifiers
Just as access specifiers (i.e. public, protected, and private) define which class members users can access,
the same access modifiers also define which class members users of a derived classes can access.

class Car : "public" vehicle {
}

Public inheritance: the public and protected members of the base class listed after the specifier keep
                        their member access in the derived class

Protected inheritance: the public and protected members of the base class listed after the specifier are
                        protected members of the derived class

Private inheritance: the public and protected members of the base class listed after the specifier are
                        private members of the derived class

Instructions
    Update the derived classes so that one has protected inheritance and one has private inheritance.
    Try to access a protected member from main(). Is it possible?
    Try to access a private member from main(). Is it possible?
    Try to access a member of the base class from within the derived class that has protected inheritance. Is it possible?
    Try to access a member of the base class from within the derived class that has private inheritance. Is it possible?
